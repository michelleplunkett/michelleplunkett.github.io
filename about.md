My name is Michelle Plunkett.

I am a graduate student at the University of Texas at Austin studying for a Master of Public Affairs degree. I plan to graduate in May of 2018.

In May of 2016, I graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I completed a Bachelor of Arts in Music Technology degree with Highest Honors (GPA above 3.75 and top 6% of class) and Bronze Tablet Honors (top 3% of class). I was able to complete this four-year program in only three years.
